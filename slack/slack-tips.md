# [Deleteme] Index

* Why reading about Slack good practices?
  * Communication will make the different between nice and excellent
  * Slack can gather most of your work related flows, optimize it!
  * What happens in Slack, stays in Slack: thus we are using Slack search

* Notifications
  * If you send a notification you expect an early response
  * If you are receiving a notification, they are expection an early response
  * Do not generate notifications if the answer can wait

* Notification tips
  * Keep your notifications down to 0
  * Mute noise: no mercy!
    * Mute @channels and @here notifications (channel settings)
    * Mute threads when you are done with it (sometimes they diverge and you might not care about the new topic)
  * Build a routine: do not read slack, process Slack
    * Start with notifications so a new notification
    * There are some public/private channels you are expected to read: do it!
  * When writing a message:
    * Would you like an early response?
      * Probably not: write your message in a channel without mention, conversation should start there in async way
      * Probably not: you probably have a regular meeting with that person, note down what you want to tell that person and add value to your sync
      * Probably not: any case not include above workarounds, re-think before notifying
    * I am adding a notification to a person, I know what I am doing
      * Option a) You need to be avaliable so synced conversation is over ASAP (consider entering a quick call)
      * Option b) Remember to respect Slack asynced basis, personal schedules and working hours

* Interacting with a human
  * Check that person's profile
    * Position, location, local time, pronoums
    * Current state, notifications snoozed?, connected?
  * Again: you are about to interact with a human
    > Hello | Good morning | Hi | ...
    > Please
    > Thank you
  * Stablish how urgent is their response from your point of view


* Why so serious?
  * 

* Shall I close Slack?
